/**
 * Spatial reasoner interface specifying a reasoner which is capable of
 * reasoning over implicit spatial relations like 'near', 'inside', 'along' etc.
 *
 * For now only geo:asWKT literals will be supported. So, geographic geometries
 * can be expressed by means of the following primitives: (examples taken from
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text)
 *
 * - POINT (long1 lat1)
 * - LINESTRING (long1 lat1, long2 lat2, long3 lat3)
 * - POLYGON ((long1 lat1, long2 lat2, long3 lat3, long4 lat4, long1 lat1))
 * - POLYGON ((long1 lat1, long2 lat2, long3 lat3, long4 lat4, long1 lat1), \
 *            (long5 lat5, long6 lat6, long7 lat7, long5 lat5))
 * - MULTIPOINT ((long1 lat1), (long2 lat2), (long3 lat3), (long4 lat4))
 * - MULTIPOINT (long1 lat1, long2 lat2, long3 lat3, long4 lat4)
 * - MULTILINESTRING ((long1 lat1, long2 lat2, long3 lat3), \
 *                    (long4 lat4, long5 lat5, long6 lat6, long7 lat7))

 *
 * The implementation of the Region Connection Calculus relations should follow
 * the relation definitions as e.g. presented in Table 1 in 'Towards Spatial
 * Reasoning in the Semantic Web: A Hybrid Knowledge Representation System
 * Architecture' by Gr√ºttler and Bauer-Messmer,
